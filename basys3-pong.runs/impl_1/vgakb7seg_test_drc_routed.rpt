2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net KEY_CONV/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin KEY_CONV/paddle1_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell KEY_CONV/paddle1_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net KEY_CONV/nreset[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin KEY_CONV/paddle0_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell KEY_CONV/paddle0_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net VGA/GAME_IMG/reset_game_reg_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin VGA/GAME_IMG/game_state_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell VGA/GAME_IMG/game_state_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net VGA/VGA_SYNC/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin VGA/VGA_SYNC/h_count_reg[9]_i_1/O, cell VGA/VGA_SYNC/h_count_reg[9]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net VGA/VGA_SYNC/v_count_reg_reg[6]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin VGA/VGA_SYNC/out_reg_i_2/O, cell VGA/VGA_SYNC/out_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT VGA/VGA_SYNC/h_count_reg[9]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
VGA/color_reg_reg[0]
Related violations: <none>
